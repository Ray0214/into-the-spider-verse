                    <h2>Reasons Why I Love This Movie!</h2>
                    <p>The animation is truly something else. This marked the first time in animation history where a film really experimented with it's 3D artstyle, calling back to it's comic book origin. Not only that, but the characters are all likable and relatable. Even the atagonist's motives come from a place of understanding, while each of the heroes feel distinct, despite all being alternate versions of the same hero. Finally, as someone who's fascinated by alternate universes, it felt very validating seeing the concept utilized to it's fullest potential on the big screen.</p>
